# go-ssr-template

- Uses Go v1.21.0
- Uses [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) v2.49.0
- Uses Mustache for Templating
- Uses Tailwind for the UI Styling
  - package.json is only used to include tailwind and the libraries to compile it. So you will need to npm i, 
  and then run the commands to compile styling if styling changes are made.
